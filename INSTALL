To build:

1. Download and extract the OpenSSH Source version 5.9p1 from one of the mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/portable.html

wget http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/openssh-5.9p1.tar.gz

2. Apply the patch file to the source of openssh

patch -i cisco_color_ssh.patch

3. Copy the two new files to the directory with the openssh source

cisco_color.c
cisco_color.h

4. Compile the ssh client

./configure
make ssh

OSX users might need to use "./configure --without-openssl-header-check"

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please do NOT use "make install" as it will likely overwrite or at least conflict 
with the version of SSH already installed.  
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

What I did to install was:

sudo cp ./ssh /usr/local/bin/cssh

This copies the client and renames it so it doesn't conflict.
